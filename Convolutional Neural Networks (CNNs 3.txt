Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are a type of artificial intelligence that can learn to recognize patterns in images. They're like smart, digital eyes that can be trained to see and understand pictures in different ways.

Common Computer Vision Problems Solved by CNNs:
Image Classification:

What it is: Telling what an image shows, like identifying if a picture is of a dog or a cat.

How CNNs help: CNNs learn to recognize different objects by looking at many pictures and understanding the patterns in them.

Object Detection:

What it is: Finding and marking all the objects in an image, like spotting multiple cars and pedestrians in a street scene.

How CNNs help: They scan the image to locate and identify each object.

Semantic Segmentation:

What it is: Coloring every pixel of an image to show what part of the image it belongs to, like separating the sky from the buildings.

How CNNs help: They break down the image into different sections and label each one.

Instance Segmentation:

What it is: Similar to semantic segmentation, but also distinguishing between different instances of the same object, like telling apart two different dogs in the same image.

How CNNs help: They identify and label each separate object individually.

Image Generation:

What it is: Creating new, realistic images from scratch, like making new artworks or creating faces that look real but don't belong to any real person.

How CNNs help: They learn from a lot of images and then generate new ones that look similar.

Style Transfer:

What it is: Changing the style of an image while keeping its content the same, like making a photo look like a painting.

How CNNs help: They separate the content of the image from its style and then mix them in different ways.

Image Captioning:

What it is: Writing descriptive captions for images, like describing a picture of a beach.

How CNNs help: They look at the image to understand what's in it and then generate a sentence to describe it.

Super-Resolution:

What it is: Making low-resolution images clearer and more detailed, like enhancing an old, blurry photo.

How CNNs help: They learn to fill in the details that are missing from the low-resolution image.

Face Recognition:

What it is: Identifying who is in a photo by looking at their facial features.

How CNNs help: They learn to recognize and match faces.

Image Denoising and Restoration:

What it is: Removing unwanted noise or fixing damaged parts of images, like cleaning up a grainy photo or repairing a torn picture.

How CNNs help: They learn to identify and correct the imperfections in images.
